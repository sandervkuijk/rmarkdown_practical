  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain affects many adults. To
               improve our daily practice, we need to understand
               multidisciplinary approaches, integrated treatment plans and the
               biopsychosocial context of these patients. To date, almost 15
               000 chronic pain patients have been referred to the Maastricht
               University Pain Center in the Netherlands. METHODS: This study
               describes 11 214 of these patients suffering from chronic pain.
               Chronic pain was analyzed using relevant Initiative on Methods,
               Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials instruments.
               RESULTS: Most patients were female (59.3\%). The prevalence of
               low education was 59\%, and unemployment/disability was 35.9\%.
               The mean age was 55.6 years. Severe pain (Numerical Rating Sale
               score 7-10) was reported by 71.9\% of the patients;
               psychological and quality of life values deteriorated when pain
               severity increased. Approximately 36\% of patients showed severe
               signs of depression or anxiety, and 39\% displayed high pain
               catastrophizing. Of all patients, 17.8\% reported high values
               for pain severity, catastrophizing and anxiety or depression.
               CONCLUSIONS: Based on baseline biopsychosocial values, this
               study shows the complexity of patients referred to pain centers.
               Pain management with a biopsychosocial approach in an integrated
               multidisciplinary setting is indispensable. Above all, adjusted
               education on chronic pain and attention to its biopsychosocial
               aspects are deemed necessary.",
